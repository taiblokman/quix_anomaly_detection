This project explores detecting anomalies in real-time stock market data using machine learning. We start by setting up a data pipeline with Kafka (Redpanda). We then implement a realtime anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest) through the Quix.io framework. We also learn how to apply other rules and filters using Quix on the streaming dataframe.
